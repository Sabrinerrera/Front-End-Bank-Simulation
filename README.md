# Front-End Bank Simulation

**Front-End Bank Simulation** was designed as part of the first-semester Computer Science project in the Introduction to Computer Science course. The project's objective is to simulate a convenient and dynamic mobile payment application, taking into account the user who needs the tool to carry out transactions in any everyday situation. Developed with standard web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it simulates data entry and the flow of money between transactions. The simulation consists of two parts: a **bank application** and a **text message** transaction simulation.
